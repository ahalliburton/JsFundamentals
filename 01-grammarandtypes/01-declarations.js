What are variables? Variables are named containers for storing data values.

We name the variables so that we can refer to this data again.

let a =2; 

let b  =  1      
/*(1) (2) (3) (4)

1-Keyword
2-Variable name
3-Assignment Operater
4-Variable Value
*/

Declarations are the left side of the variable:
It is simply the var x
It is on the left side of the assignment operator

Initializations are the right side of a variable
It sets the value of the variable
It incorporates the variable name(x), the assignment operator (=), and the value (10)=> x =10
(=) assignment operatoris not the same as the equal operator.Variables

let x;
console.log('Declaration:', x);

x = 10;
console.log('Initializing 1:', x);

x = 33;
console.log('Initializing 2:', x);

let y = 'Hello';
console.log('Both:', x, y);

let today = 'Great!';
const elevenFifty = 'Wonderful';
console.log(today, elevenFifty);

elevenFifty = 'Superr';
console.log()
